      <p class="mb-6">
        I is a full-stack developer and content creator from Chicago who has a severe caffine addiction. I love
        building applications using C#, JavaScript, and Python. I'm learning Rust and
        Solidity for Web3.0 and eventually want to dive back into Swift and iOS development.
        I currently living in the Chicago suburbs with my fianc&#233; Sam and our three cats.

      <h3 class="text-3xl mb-3">The long story üìñ</h3>
      <h4 class="text-xl">What do I do?</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">
        I build applications and create content around coding, productivity, and lifestyle for developers. My goal is make the
        world of software more accessible to others. We're such a large, diverse industry that offers something to
        everybody. I like to have discussions things in various programming languages and frameworks. I also enjoy sharing my thoughts
        on developer lifestyle and productivity. This includes things from thoughts on books to healthy eating and exercise to
        building habits and goal setting.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-xl">What's my story?</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">
        I've been working as a developer for about two and a half years now. I started with doing some freelancing
        and then got a job doing C# and .NET programming. My primary tech stack is C# and JavaScript, but I do enjoy doing
        some Python should there be a need for it! I love working in .NET, NextJS, and Django when I can. I am also learning
        how to build apps that interface with the Ethereum blockchain with Solidity, along with learning Rust for WASM.
        I had a fling with Swift and iOS that I would love to get back into!
      </p>
      <p class="my-3">
        I've been coding for as long as I can remeber. As a kid I grew up playing computer games like Star Wars: Galactic
        Battlegrounds, which was an Age of Empires game with a Star Wars skin. At one point, I remember wanting to start a blog
        and going so far as to find a tutorial in Ruby on Rails! I ended up making a Tumblr and blogging on there for a little bit
        instead, but that interest and curiosity in building things never left me.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        In the eigth grade, I built my first game using Scratch and drag and drop modules. I had built it for a project in
        my social studies class. It was pretty buggy but it was so cool to do! In high schoool, I then grew an interest in iOS, which at the time was
        still in Objective-C and never did anything with that. I did get into building Minecraft texture packs and modding the game.
        High school also was when I built my first PC.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        My junior year I took my first formal course of programming, AP Computer Science. That class was in Java and it was
        then I figured out that I loved programming. The next year I took a specialized study through our community college on C#
        and game development. There I got to play with those technologies as well as setting up web servers and deploying static
        files to them. We were supposed to do PHP, but didn't have time for it. Then I started college and the rest is history! I
        graduated in May of 2021 with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-xl">Do I do anything not tech related?</h4>
      <p class="my-3">
        Outside of coding, I love reading and writing. My favorite kinds of books to read are science fiction, math and technology,
        personal fiance, and motivational/productivity novels. Currently I keep a daily journal where I write down my random thoughts
        and ideas and use this site to share things I've learned about or found interesting. I also use Twitter to share my thoughts as well!
        One day, I would like to write a book. I'm not sure what genre yet I would like to write in, but it's a goal I have!
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I am currently living in the Chicago Suburbs with my fianc&#233; Sam and our three cats. We do a lot of fun things together with
        each other as well as our families. We our wedding is June of 2022 and we can't wait for it! We love taking vacations of all
        kinds together, watching whatever Marvel or Star Wars show is on Disney+, and even just reading together!
